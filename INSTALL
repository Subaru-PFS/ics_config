This git module (ics_mhs_root) is intended to help distribute a
complete set of all the git modules required to run the PFS ICS at the
observatory. Tagged versions of this product will bring in tagged
versions of the other modules.

Note that git submodules are in general _not_ a good mechanism for
developing a group of independant modules: the book-keeping is
peculiar and not very safe. Developer beware!
